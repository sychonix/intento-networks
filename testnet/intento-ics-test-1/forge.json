        "description": "Intento is the blockchain for secure, self-custodial and scalable orchestration of intent-driven actions across any blockchain using real-time inputs, on-chain. Intento enables seamless execution of intent-driven action flows across any blockchain, transforming the way users interact with on-chain systems. By leveraging real-time inputs, Intento ensures that any action can be set, anywhere and anytime, based on predefined conditions—bridging the gap between user intention and execution. Built on the Cosmos SDK, Intento integrates IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication), Interchain Accounts, and Interchain Query capabilities to revolutionize on-chain workflows. Unlike with smart contracts, Intento allows developers and users to construct self-custodial, scalable, and secure workflows without relying on smart contracts. Designed for intuitive and efficient execution across IBC-connected chains, Intento supports a broad range of use cases—from simple scheduled payments to complex interchain operations. By eliminating friction in blockchain interactions, Intento makes decentralized processes more accessible, automated, and powerful for both developers and users.",
